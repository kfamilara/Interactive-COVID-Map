* Here I just imported the file for each day. I also added a "population" variable to each file before importing.
The population variable included the population for each state. This variable can be found in the
 "UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv" file in the Johns Hopkins Database;

proc import datafile: "Johns Hopkins File (e.g. 1-11-2021)"
dbms =csv
out: COVID.final;
getnames=yes;
run;

*I created a new variable "per100" that represented the active cases per 100,000 population;
*Then I turned per100 into a categorical variable with 5 categories;

data COVID.final;
set COVID.final;
per100 = active/population * 100000;
state =FIPS;
if per100 < 200 then per100cat = 1;
else if per100 < 400 then per100cat = 2;
else if per100 < 1000 then per100cat = 3;
else if per100 < 7000 then per100cat = 4;
else if per100 < 10000 then per100cat = 5;
run;


*Here I picked out the colors for the map;

pattern1 value=solid color=white;
pattern2 value=solid color=khaki;
pattern3 value=solid color =orange;
pattern4 value = solid color=red;
pattern5 value=solid color=darkred;

*Here I formatted the variable"
proc format;
value labels 1 = "less than 200" 2 = "200 to 400" 3 = "400 to 1000" 4 = "1000 to 7000" 5 = " greater than 7000";
run;

* I added the legend and title;
legend1 shape=bar(4,2) across=3  label= ("Active cases per" j=left "100,000 people") frame;

title "February 2nd, 2021";

*This is the most important part;
*This is where the graph is made!!!!!;

proc gmap data=COVID.final map=maps.us;
format per100cat labels.;
id state;

*I repeated this process for each day (Jan 1, Jan2 ,Jan 3, etc.)
