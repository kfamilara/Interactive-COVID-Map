# Interactive-COVID-Map
I am an MPH student in Epidemiology looking for a practicum for the summer of 2021! I recently made this application
Interactive COVID Map January to February
This application was made using the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

The maps were made using the SAS code, which is included in this repository.
The interactive map was made using html, css, and javascript. All of the code is in this repository!
Enjoy! And use freely!!
